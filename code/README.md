# Semantic Kernel OpenAPI Skill Sample Project

This is a sample project to demonstrate the Semantic Kernel OpenAPI skill. It consists of a clothing API, which is a Swagger API, and a Copilot chat app.

The Copilot chat app is an enriched intelligence app, with multiple dynamic components including command messages, user intent, and memories. The chat prompt and response will evolve as the conversation between the user and the application proceeds. This chat experience is orchestrated with Semantic Kernel and a Copilot Chat skill containing numerous functions that work together to construct each response.

## Clothing API

The Clothing API is a Swagger API that provides endpoints for managing clothing items. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete clothing items, as well as search for items by various criteria.

## Copilot Chat App

The Copilot chat app is a sample app that demonstrates how to build your own integrated large language model chat copilot using Semantic Kernel and a Copilot Chat skill. It provides a chat interface where users can interact with the app using natural language. The app uses Semantic Kernel to understand the user's intent and generate appropriate responses.

## Getting Started

To get started with this sample project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README files for the Clothing API and the Copilot Chat app.
